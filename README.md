# Runescape_Quest_Manager

## About
I'm making Quest Manager because I want to have a better way to manage my long-term quest goals in Runescape. Existing quest resources that I know of like the tip.it's [quest requirement calculator](http://www.tip.it/runescape/pages/view/quest_requirement_calculator.htm) and [quest calculator](http://www.tip.it/runescape/quests/calculator), along with simply looking at the dropdown quest requirements at [rs wiki](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/RuneScape_Wiki) are very helpful, but I'd like to combine these sorts of tools into one spot, and in addition combine it with things like a skill-goal tracker that tells you how much more experience you need to get to your quest goal requirements. I think it's a fun project.

Developed in Python 2.
